The outcome of the battle seemed beyond doubt.Some 40,000 Romans faced only 10,000 Parthians, and Rome's legions were Europe's finest foot soldiers. There was just one problem. The Parthian army didn't fight on foot. The Parthians, they were cavalry, they were horse archers. Versatile, rode like the wind. What the Romans did was what the Romans always did, they took a fixed position. They were ordered into a hollow square, defending all sides. But that was nothing to the Parthian horse archers, because they could just ride around them, and they did. They galloped around and around and around and around, shooting as they went. Thousands and thousands of arrows, thousands of arrows, loosed into those Romans. What the Romans eventually did was they were ordered to go into testudo. That's that Roman formation where they lock their shields together and put the next layer of shields to make a roof. Testudo is Latin for tortoise. But the Parthians had the answer to this tortoise. They had a hammer to break open its shell. The Parthian hammer was a cataphract, a Greek word meaning clothed in full armour. Horse and rider wore heavy coats of mail. The cataphract was the ancient world's equivalent of a battle tank. At Care, charging cataphracts broke open the testudo, exposing the Romans inside to more arrow attacks. Some 30,000 Romans were killed or captured. Parthian losses were minor. It was one of Rome's worst military defeats. But it may have been something else as well. A Roman historian wrote that the Parthians dazzled the Romans with banners made of a blue stone.\n",

Horses were not used as organized cavalry until after about 900 BC, almost 1,000 years after chariot warfare began. And it's always seemed odd to me that cavalry began after chariotry. Chariotry is very difficult to manage. You have to train horses to work together. They have to pull this clumsy vehicle that has two people in it, a driver and a warrior, training the units to work together. Very difficult thing to do, whereas jumping on the back of a horse is an easy thing. So why did cavalry come after chariotry? I think the real reason that cavalry waited is that you needed to have really three innovations. The earliest evidence for the recurve bow is in Shang Dynasty China, probably dated between 1300 and 1100 BC. Shang emperors communicated with their ancestors by heating animal bones or turtle shells until they cracked, and then interpreting the patterns made by the cracks. One of these so-called oracle bones is carved with a Chinese character for bow, the earliest known image of a recurved bow. And in the tomb of Lady Fuhao, an imperial consort and renowned military commander, archaeologists found more evidence. It's a thumb cover for drawing the bow string, and there's another piece that went in the middle of a recurve bow, a hand grip. The bows themselves are not preserved, so it's a difficult thing to identify the origins of the recurve bow. The different components of it probably came from different places geographically. Just how far the recurve bow traveled across Eurasia was revealed in 2005 at Yonghai in China's Xinjiang region. Wooden bows rarely survive burial in the ground, but Xinjiang's cold, dry climate preserved one in a 3,000-year-old tomb. Other grave goods and the human remains found in the Yonghai tombs confirmed that the bow was made by the Scythians, a highly sophisticated culture that originated in southern Russia and migrated on horseback across the length and breadth of Eurasia.
