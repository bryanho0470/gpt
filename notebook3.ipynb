       "[Document(page_content='Allotment (gardening)\\rAllotments in Germany\\rAn\\xa0allotment\\xa0(British English),[1]\\xa0is a plot of land made available for individual, non-commercial gardening for growing food plants, so forming a\\xa0kitchen garden\\xa0away from the residence of the user. Such plots are formed by subdividing a piece of land into a few or up to several hundred parcels that are assigned to individuals or families, contrary to a\\xa0community garden\\xa0where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people. [2]\\xa0The term \"victory garden\" is also still sometimes used, especially when a garden dates back to the\\xa0First\\xa0or\\xa0Second World War. The individual size of a parcel typically suits the needs of a family, and often the plots include a shed for tools and shelter, and sometimes a hut for seasonal or weekend accommodation. The individual gardeners are usually organised in an allotment association, which leases or is granted the land from an owner who may be a public, private or\\xa0ecclesiastical\\xa0entity, and who usually stipulates that it be only used for gardening (i.e., growing vegetables, fruits and flowers), but not for permanent residential purposes (this is usually also required by\\xa0zoning laws). The gardeners have to pay a small membership fee to the association and have to abide by the corresponding constitution and by-laws. However, the membership entitles them to certain democratic rights.\\n\\n[3][4]\\rSocio-cultural and economic functions\\r[edit]\\rAn allotment garden in\\xa0Petsamo,\\xa0Tampere, Finland\\rThe\\xa0Luxembourg-based\\xa0Office International du Coin de Terre et des Jardins Familiaux, representing three million European allotment gardeners since 1926, describes the socio-cultural and economic functions of allotment gardens as offering an improved quality of life, an enjoyable and profitable hobby, relaxation, and contact with nature. For children, gardens offer places to play and to learn about nature, while for the unemployed, they offer a feeling of doing something useful as well as low-cost food. For the elderly and disabled, gardens offer an opportunity to meet people, to share in activity with like-minded people, and to experience activities like planting and harvesting. [5]\\rBy country\\r[edit]\\rAustria\\r[edit]\\rThe first garden was started in\\xa0Purkersdorf\\xa0in 1905. [6][7]\\rCanada\\r[edit]\\rIn cities like\\xa0Vancouver,\\xa0Toronto,\\xa0Calgary,\\xa0Montreal, and\\xa0Ottawa, these are called community gardens. [8]\\rCzechoslovakia\\r[edit]\\rAllotment plot,\\xa0Prague, Czech Republic\\rAllotment gardening used to be widely popular in the former\\xa0Czechoslovakia\\xa0under the communist regime. It gave people from suburban prefab apartment blocks – called\\xa0paneláky\\xa0in Czech – a chance to escape from city chaos, pollution, and concrete architecture. Holiday houses\\xa0and gardens served also as the only permitted form of investment of savings for common\\xa0middle-class\\xa0citizens.\\n\\n[citation needed]\\rDenmark\\r[edit]\\rIn 1778, land was laid out outside the fortifications of the town of\\xa0Fredericia\\xa0for allotment gardens, and, according to an 1828 circular from the royal chancellery allotment, gardens were established in several towns. [citation needed]\\rPrivate initiative formed the first Danish allotment association in\\xa0Aalborg\\xa0in 1884, and in\\xa0Copenhagen\\xa0an association named\\xa0Arbejdernes Værn\\xa0(lit. \\'The Workers\\' Protection\\') founded the first allotment gardens of the Danish Capital in 1891. Since then, allotment gardens have spread to most Danish towns. [citation needed]\\rThe Oval Allotment Gardens,\\xa0Nærum, DenmarkKolonihave in winter,\\xa0Skovlunde, Denmark\\rIn 1904, there were about 20,000 allotment gardens in\\xa0Denmark. 6,000 of them were in Copenhagen. During the interwar years, the number of allotment gardens grew rapidly. In 2001, the number of allotment gardens was estimated to be about 62,120. [citation needed]\\rIn 1908, twenty allotment associations in\\xa0Copenhagen\\xa0formed the Allotment Garden Union, which in 1914 was expanded to cover all of Denmark. The Allotment Garden Federation was founded to negotiate more favourable deals with the state and the municipalities from which the allotments associations rented the land. Today, the federation represents roughly 400 allotment associations in 75 municipalities. [citation needed]\\rThe Danish tradition for allotment gardens later spread to the other Nordic countries: first\\xa0Sweden, then\\xa0Norway\\xa0and\\xa0Finland.\\n\\n[9]\\rToday, most allotment gardens are on land owned by the municipality, which rents the land to an allotment association. The association in turn gives each member a plot of land. To preserve allotment gardens as something that is available for all kinds of people, the membership charge is set significantly below what a market price would be. Since allotments are often placed on attractive plots of land, this has led to huge waiting lists for membership in many allotment associations. [citation needed]\\rAlthough the main purpose of the allotment is gardening, most allotment gardens have a pavilion built in them. These pavilions can range in size from an old rebuilt railway car to a small summer house. Many people grow so fond of their allotment gardens that they live there the entire summer. In most cases, however, members are not allowed to live there the entire year. [citation needed]\\rFinland\\r[edit]\\rAllotment gardens in\\xa0Vallila, only 2–3 km from central\\xa0Helsinki. Each allotment contains a summer-cottage-type building. The Federation of Finnish Allotment Gardens is a non-profit organization that supports allotment gardeners and connects them to allotments and each other. The first allotment garden was established 1916 in\\xa0Tampere,[10]\\xa0and today there are about 30 allotment associations all around Finland made up of roughly 3700 allotmenteers.\\n\\n[11]\\rFrance\\r[edit]\\rFamily gardens, or allotments, which appeared at the end of the 19th century, are plots of land made available to inhabitants by municipalities. These plots, most often allocated to vegetable gardening, were initially intended to improve the living conditions of the workers by providing them with social balance and food self-sufficiency. Today, they are enjoying renewed interest by helping to create “green oases” near cities, which are useful in the face of the threat of global warming. They also respond to current concerns to produce vegetables locally by low-income categories of the population and participate in creating \"social ties\" in urbanized areas. Created in February 2007, the National Council of Collective and Family Gardens (CNJCF) aims to encourage and promote their development, the protection of plant heritage and biodiversity, gardening that respects the environment and defends its positions with public authorities and other institutions. The CNJCF today federates nearly 135,000 members, making up the three founding associations: the National Horticultural Society of France (SNHF), the National Federation of Family and Collective Gardens (FNJFC)15 and the Garden of the Railwayman (Jardinot).\\n\\nGermany\\r[edit]\\rAllotments in Schwabing, Munich\\rThe history of the allotment gardens in\\xa0Germany\\xa0is closely connected with the period of\\xa0industrialization\\xa0and\\xa0urbanization\\xa0in Europe during the 19th century, when a large number of people migrated from the rural areas to the cities to find employment and a better life. Very often, these families were living under extremely poor conditions, suffering from inappropriate housing,\\xa0malnutrition\\xa0and other forms of social neglect. To improve their overall situation and to allow them to grow their own food, the city administrations, the churches or their employers provided open spaces for garden purposes. These were initially called the \"gardens of the poor\". [citation needed]\\rThe idea of organised allotment gardening reached a first peak after 1864, when the so-called \"Schreber\\xa0Movement\" started in the city of\\xa0Leipzig\\xa0in\\xa0Saxony. A public initiative decided to lease areas within the city, to give children a healthy and close-to-nature environment to play in. Later, these areas included actual gardens for children, but soon adults tended towards taking over and cultivating these gardens. This kind of gardening also became popular in other European countries, especially Germanic countries such as\\xa0Austria\\xa0(and its dependencies), the\\xa0Netherlands\\xa0and\\xa0Switzerland.\\n\\n[12][13][14][15][16]\\xa0In German-speaking countries, allotment gardens are accordingly generally known as\\xa0Schrebergärten\\xa0(singular:\\xa0Schrebergarten), sometimes literally translated as \"Schreber gardens\". Another common term is\\xa0Kleingärten\\xa0(\\'small gardens\\', singular:\\xa0Kleingarten). [citation needed]\\rThe aspect of\\xa0food security\\xa0provided by allotment gardens became particularly evident during\\xa0World Wars\\xa0I and II. The socio-economic situation was very miserable, particularly regarding the nutritional status of urban residents. Many cities were isolated from their rural hinterlands and agricultural products did not reach the city markets anymore or were sold at very high prices on the black market. Consequently, food production within the city, especially fruit and vegetable production in\\xa0home gardens\\xa0and allotment gardens, became essential for survival. The importance of allotment gardens for food security was so obvious that in 1919, one year after the end of\\xa0World War I, the first legislation for allotment gardening in Germany was passed. The so-called \"Small Garden and Small-Rent Land Law\", provided security in land tenure and fixed leasing fees. In 1983, this law was amended by the\\xa0Federal Allotment Gardens Act\\xa0[de]\\xa0(Bundeskleingartengesetz). Today, there are still about 1.4 million allotment gardens in Germany, covering an area of 470\\xa0km2\\xa0(180\\xa0sq\\xa0mi). [17]\\xa0In Berlin alone, there are 833 allotment garden complexes.\\n\\n[18]\\rMalta\\r[edit]\\rAllotments at Għammieri,\\xa0Malta\\rMalta\\xa0introduced its first allotment gardens in April 2011. [19]\\xa0The objective of the scheme, which was called\\xa0Midd Idejk fil-Biedja\\xa0(\\'Try Your Hand at Farming\\'), was to encourage people, especially the young and those living in urban areas, to take up organic farming. The scheme had over 50 allotment plots located at Għammieri,\\xa0Malta, with each plot measuring 50 square metres in size. [20]\\xa0All plots were fully irrigated and those who participated in the scheme received continual support and training. Malta\\'s allotment gardens were terminated in 2013, following a change in administration. [21]\\xa0In September, 2019,\\xa0Heritage Malta, an agency which falls under the Ministry for Culture, started an initiative to re-introduce the concept of allotments. [22]\\xa0Located just above the\\xa0Abbatija Tad-Dejr\\xa0catacombs in\\xa0Rabat, the new allotment plots were issued with several restrictions in an effort to protect the sensitivity of the archaeological site. [23][24]\\rNetherlands\\r[edit]\\rAllotment in\\xa0Rotterdam\\rThe first allotment gardens in the\\xa0Netherlands\\xa0were founded in 1838. In the 19th century, cities started allotment gardens for working-class families. Around the first world war, in which the Netherlands remained neutral, the users of the gardens started demanding that the gardens would be governed by the members.\\n\\nIn 1928, the allotment garden societies founded the national level\\xa0het Algemeen Verbond van Volkstuindersverenigingen in Nederland\\xa0(AVVN). During the German Occupation of WWII, many \"Volkstuinen\" started. Until the 1950s, the gardens were primarily used for vegetable production; since then there has been a shift to recreational use. Depending on the city and society, small sheds, greenhouses or small garden houses are allowed. In some cases, permanent habitation is allowed during summertime. The Netherlands has 240,000 allotments. [citation needed]\\rNorway\\r[edit]\\rThere are 13 allotment gardens in\\xa0Norway, with around 2000 allotments. The oldest,\\xa0Rodeløkkens Kolonihager, dates to 1907. The largest, Solvang Kolonihager, has around 600 allotments and is in Oslo, close to the woods and Sognsvann lake. The allotment gardens are quite popular, and there can be a waiting list of 10 and in some cases even 20 years. [citation needed]\\rPhilippines\\r[edit]\\rKauswagan Allotment Garden,\\xa0Cagayan de Oro\\rIn 2003, the first allotment garden of the\\xa0Philippines\\xa0was established in Cagayan de Oro,\\xa0Northern Mindanao\\xa0as part of a European Union funded project. [25]\\xa0Meanwhile, with the assistance of the German Embassy in Manila and several private donors from Germany, this number has grown to five self-sustaining gardens located in different urban areas of the city, enabling a total of 55 urban poor families the legal access to land for food production.\\n\\nFurther four allotment gardens, two of them within the premises of public elementary schools are presently being set up for additional 36 families using the\\xa0asset-based community development\\xa0approach. [26]\\xa0Some of the gardeners belong to the poorest in the city, the garbage pickers of the city\\'s landfill site. [27]\\xa0Aside from different vegetables, the gardeners grow also\\xa0herbs\\xa0and\\xa0tropical fruits. In some gardens, small animals are kept and fish ponds are maintained to avail the gardeners of additional protein sources for the daily dietary needs. Each allotment garden has a\\xa0compost\\xa0heap where\\xa0biodegradable wastes\\xa0from the garden as well as from the neighboring households are converted into organic fertilizer, thus contributing to the integrated solid waste management program of the city. Further, all gardens are equipped with so-called urine-diverting\\xa0ecological sanitation\\xa0toilets similar to practices in Danish allotment gardens described by Bregnhøj et al. (2003). [28]\\rPoland\\r[edit]\\rROD imienia ks. L. Przyłuskiego, allotment gardens in Poznań, Poland\\rIn Poland, allotment gardens date back to 1897 when Doctor Jan Jalkowski founded the \\'Sun Baths\\' (Polish:\\xa0Kąpiele słoneczne) community gardens and health area in\\xa0Grudziądz. [29]\\xa0The emergence of allotment gardens in Poland, similarly to the situation in other European countries, was linked to the industrialisation epoque.\\n\\nThe creation of the allotments was treated as a response to food and health problems of a growing number of rural population migrating into cities. [30][31]\\xa0Former peasants were encouraged to reproduce their rural subsistence patterns in a new environment to increase social stability through additional food provision, creation of green spaces, and exercise. [32]\\xa0The organisers opted that the gardens should first and foremost meet the needs of the poorest. [33]\\rThe role of allotment gardens did not change significantly in the twentieth century. [34]\\xa0During the Communist regime allotment gardeners were mostly focused on improving the household budget by producing food for family needs. [35]\\xa0In the late 1980s, food expenses comprised 40% of the household budget. [36]\\xa0It was also during that time when spending time at the allotment gardens (Polish:\\xa0działkowanie) became a cultural phenomenon. [33]\\rWith the collapse of Communism and the arrival of Capitalism, the function and main purpose of the allotment gardens were redefined. [35]\\xa0In 2013 the regulator characterised their primary role as to satisfy recreational and other social needs – food security was only mentioned among the latter. [37]\\rCurrently, there are 965,000 registered allotment gardeners in Poland. [38]\\xa0Allotment gardeners, who cultivate publicly owned urban space, constitute the largest group of city land managers in the country.\\n\\n[35]\\xa0The transition from the predominantly productive character of the allotments to the pleasure gardens that has been observed in Poland is the combined result of market trends, current aesthetic needs, pressure from allotment administrators, and city developers willing to adopt these attractive green spaces. [34]\\xa0Progressive urbanization is threatening the existence of allotment gardens especially those located in city centres, the other threat is an idea of turning allotments into public open spaces, which would most probably transform them into parks. [39]\\rIn the past years, the interest in allotment gardens has been rising again, mostly around younger people who see their environmental, community building, and leisure potential. [33]\\rPortugal\\r[edit]\\rAllotments on the outskirts of Lisbon\\rSince 2011, the municipality of Lisbon has created more than 19 allotment gardens (parques hortícolas\\xa0or\\xa0hortas urbanas). [40]\\xa0These are granted to residents by means of a public application process. [41]\\rOtherwise, allotment gardens in Portugal are often precarious, as land is spontaneously divided into strips as cities grow. [citation needed]\\rRussia\\r[edit]\\rRussian allotments (dacha),\\xa0Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, RussiaAllotments at Sista-Palkino,\\xa0Lomonosovsky District, Leningrad Oblast, by the Sista river\\rThe first allotments (\"dachas\") in\\xa0Russia\\xa0began to appear during the\\xa0reign\\xa0of\\xa0Peter the Great.\\n\\nInitially they were small\\xa0estates\\xa0in the\\xa0country, which were given to loyal vassals by the\\xa0Tsar. In archaic Russian, the word\\xa0dacha\\xa0(да́ча) means\\xa0something given. [citation needed]\\rDuring the\\xa0Age of Enlightenment,\\xa0Russian\\xa0aristocracy\\xa0used their allotments for social and cultural gatherings, which were usually accompanied by\\xa0masquerade balls\\xa0and\\xa0fireworks\\xa0displays. The\\xa0Industrial Revolution\\xa0brought about a rapid growth in the urban population, and urban residents increasingly desired to escape the heavily polluted cities, at least temporarily. By the end of the 19th century, the allotment became a favorite summer retreat for the\\xa0upper\\xa0and middle classes of Russian society. [citation needed]\\rAfter the\\xa0Bolshevik revolution\\xa0of 1917, most dachas were\\xa0nationalized. Some were converted into vacation homes for the\\xa0working class, while others, usually of better quality, were distributed among the prominent\\xa0functionaries\\xa0of the\\xa0Communist Party\\xa0and the newly emerged cultural and scientific\\xa0elite. All but a few allotments remained the property of the state and the right to use them was usually revoked when a dacha occupant was dismissed or fell out of favor with the rulers of the state. Joseph Stalin\\'s favourite Dacha was in\\xa0Gagra,\\xa0Abkhazia. [42]\\xa0The construction of new dachas was restricted until the late 1940s and required the special approval of the Communist Party leadership. [citation needed]\\rThe period after\\xa0World War II\\xa0saw a moderate growth in dacha development.\\n\\nSince there was no actual law banning the construction of dachas,\\xa0squatters\\xa0began occupying unused plots of land near\\xa0cities\\xa0and towns, some building\\xa0sheds,\\xa0huts, and more prominent dwellings that served as dachas. This practice of squatting was spurred by the desire of urban dwellers, all living in multi-story\\xa0apartment buildings, to spend some time close to nature, and also to grow their own fruits and vegetables. The latter was caused by the failure of the\\xa0centrally planned\\xa0Soviet\\xa0agricultural program to supply enough fresh\\xa0produce. As time passed, the number of squatters grew geometrically and the government had no choice but to officially recognize their right to amateur farming. The 1955\\xa0legislation\\xa0introduced a new type of\\xa0legal entity\\xa0into the\\xa0Soviet\\xa0juridical system, a so-called \"gardeners\\' partnership\" (садоводческое товарищество; not to be confused with community garden). The gardeners\\' partnerships received the right to permanent use of land exclusively for agricultural purposes and permission to connect to public electrical and\\xa0water supply\\xa0networks. In 1958, yet another form of organization was introduced, a \"cooperative for dacha construction (DSK)\" (дачно-строительный кооператив), which recognized the right of an individual to build a small house on the land leased from the government.\\n\\n[citation needed]\\rThe 1980s saw the peak of the dacha boom, with virtually every affluent family in the country having a dacha of their own or spending weekends and holidays at friends\\' dachas. Often ill-equipped and without indoor\\xa0plumbing, dachas were nevertheless the ultimate solution for millions of Russian working-class families to having an inexpensive summer retreat. Having a piece of land also offered an opportunity for city dwellers to indulge themselves in growing their own fruits and vegetables. To this day,\\xa0May Day\\xa0holidays remain a feature of Russian life allowing urban residents a long weekend to plant seeds and tend fruit trees as the ground defrosts from the long Russian winter. [citation needed]\\xa0Since there are no other national holidays that are long enough for planting, many employers give their staff an extra day off specifically for that purpose. [citation needed]\\rThe\\xa0collapse of communism\\xa0in the Soviet Union saw the return to private\\xa0land ownership. Most dachas have since been\\xa0privatized, and Russia is now the nation with the largest number of owners of\\xa0second homes. [citation needed]\\xa0The growth of living standards in recent years allowed many dacha owners to spend their\\xa0discretionary income\\xa0on improvements. Thus, many recently built dachas are fully equipped houses suitable for use as permanent residences.\\n\\nThe market-oriented economy transformed the dacha into an asset, which generally reflects the prosperity of its owner and can be freely traded in the real estate market. [citation needed]\\rDue to the rapid increase in urbanization in Russia, many village houses are currently being sold to be used as allotments. Many Russian villages now have\\xa0dachniki\\xa0(да́чники) as temporary residents. Some villages have been fully transformed into dacha settlements, while some older dacha settlements often look like more permanent lodgings. The advantages of purchasing a dacha in a village usually are: lower costs, greater land area, and larger distances between houses. The disadvantages may include: lower-quality utilities, less security, and typically a farther distance to travel. [citation needed]\\rSweden\\r[edit]\\rBarnängen, Stockholm allotment garden in 1915Allotment huts in the open-air museum\\xa0Skansen, Stockholm\\rIn\\xa0Landskrona, around the area of the\\xa0Citadel, the first allotment gardens of\\xa0Sweden\\xa0were made available for lease in the 1860s,[43]\\xa0later followed by those in\\xa0Malmö\\xa0in 1895, and\\xa0Stockholm\\xa0in 1904. The local authorities were inspired by\\xa0Anna Lindhagen, a social-democratic leader and a woman in the upper ranks of society, who visited allotment gardens in Copenhagen and was delighted by them.\\n\\nIn her first book on the topic devoted to the usefulness of allotment gardens she wrote:\\rFor the family, the plot of land is a uniting bond, where all family members can meet in shared work and leisure. The family father, tired with the cramped space at home, may rejoice in taking care of his family in the open air, and feel responsible if the little plot of earth bestows a very special interest upon life. [44]\\rAnna Lindhagen is said to have met Lenin when he passed through Stockholm from the exile in Switzerland on their return trip to Russia after the February Revolution in 1917. [45]\\xa0She invited him to the allotment gardens of Barnängen to show all its benefits. However, she did not win his approval. Lenin was totally unresponsive to this kind of activity. To poke in the soil was to prepare the ground for political laziness in the\\xa0class struggle. The workers should not be occupied with gardening, they should rather devote themselves to the\\xa0proletarian revolution. [46]\\rThe\\xa0Swedish Federation of Leisure Gardening\\xa0was founded in 1921 and represents today more than 26,000 allotment and leisure gardeners. The members are organised in about 275 local societies all over Sweden. The land is usually rented from the local authorities. [citation needed]\\rTurkey\\r[edit]\\rHobby Gardens in Turkey\\rAllotments or hobby gardens (Turkish:\\xa0hobi bahçeleri) as they are known in Turkey became really popular after 2000s.\\n\\nA hobby garden or organic garden is an area or plot of land where vegetables and fruits can be grown. Hobby gardens, which have become very popular in recent years, offer a natural environment in city life. Hobby gardens, which are mostly prepared by municipalities and put into service by charging annual rental fees, are now used by many people to grow vegetables and fruits and to be in touch with nature. The size of the hobby garden and the type of soil may vary depending on the region. Hobby gardens can also be put up for sale through share deeds. In addition, in the parceling prepared, the hobby garden must be specified in the same way on the real land. United Kingdom\\r[edit]\\rBoys creating an allotment on a bomb site in London, 1942Allotments in the rural village of\\xa0JordansUK allotment gardens near Middlesbrough, showing typical sheds and use of junk and recycled materials\\rA 1732 engraving of\\xa0Birmingham, England, shows the town encircled by allotments, some of which still exist to this day. Another old allotment site is Great Somerford Free Gardens in the\\xa0Wiltshire\\xa0village of\\xa0Great Somerford. These were created in 1809 following a letter to\\xa0King George III\\xa0from Rev Stephen Demainbray (a\\xa0chaplain to the king) in which he asked the king to spare, in perpetuity, six acres from the\\xa0Inclosure Acts\\xa0for the benefit of the poor of his parish.\\n\\n[47][48]\\rFollowing these Inclosure Acts and the Commons Act 1876,[49]\\xa0the land available for personal cultivation by the poor was greatly diminished. To fulfill the need for land, allotment legislation was enacted. The law was first fully codified in the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908,[50]\\xa0then modified by the Allotments Act 1922[51]\\xa0and subsequent Allotments Acts up until the\\xa0Allotments Act 1950. Under the Acts, a local authority is required to maintain an \"adequate provision\" of land, usually a large allotment field which can then be subdivided into allotment gardens for individual residents at a low rent. Allotment sizes are often quoted in square rods, although the use of the rod has been illegal for trade purposes since 1965. [52]\\xa0The rent is set at what a person \"may reasonably be expected to pay\" (1950); in 1997 the average rent for a ten\\xa0square rods, or\\xa01⁄16\\xa0acre (250\\xa0m2) plot was £22 a year. In February 2012 the UK\\'s first\\xa0Green-controlled council,\\xa0Brighton and Hove, caused controversy when they stated their intention to raise the rent for a standard 250\\xa0m2\\xa0plot to £110 per year, with many people suggesting that this was contrary to the environmental agenda on which they were elected. Each plot cannot exceed forty square rods, i.e. 1⁄4\\xa0acre (1,000\\xa0m2) and must be used for the production of fruit or vegetables for consumption by the plot-holder and their family (1922), or of flowers for use by the plot-holder and their family.\\n\\nThe exact size and quality of the plots is not defined. The council has a duty to provide sufficient allotments to meet demand. The total income from allotments was £2.61 million and total expenditure was £8.44 million in 1997. [53]\\rThe total number of plots has varied greatly over time. In the 19th and early 20th century, the allotment system supplied much of the fresh vegetables eaten by the poor. [54]\\xa0In 1873 there were 244,268 plots and by 1918 there were around 1,500,000 plots. While numbers fell in the 1920s and 1930s, following an increase to 1,400,000 during World War II there were still around 1,117,000 plots in 1948. This number has been in decline since then, falling to 600,000 by the late 1960s and 300,000 by 2009. The Thorpe Inquiry of 1969 investigated the decline and put the causes as the decline in available land, increasing prosperity and the growth of other leisure activities. [55]\\rThe popular 1970s British television programme\\xa0The Good Life, about a couple seeking to \"escape the rat race\" by becoming \"totally self-sufficient\" in a suburban setting, utilised an allotment to achieve their aims. [citation needed]\\xa0Increased interest in \"green\" issues from the 1970s revived interest in allotment gardening, whilst the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners (NSALG), and the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society (SAGS) in Scotland, continued to campaign on behalf of allotment users.\\n\\nHowever, the rate of decline was only slowed, falling from 530,000 plots in 1970 to 497,000 in 1977, although there was a substantial waiting list. By 1980 the surge in interest was over, and by 1997 the number of plots had fallen to around 265,000, with waiting lists of 13,000 and 44,000 vacant plots. In 2008\\xa0The Guardian\\xa0reported that 330,000 people held an allotment, whilst 100,000 were on waiting lists. [56]\\rIn 2006, a report commissioned by the\\xa0London Assembly[57]\\xa0identified that whilst demand was at an all-time high across the capital, the pressure caused by high-density building was further decreasing the amount of allotment land. The issue was given further publicity when\\xa0The Guardian\\xa0newspaper reported on the community campaign against the potential impact of the development for the\\xa02012 Summer Olympics\\xa0on the future of the century-old\\xa0Manor Garden Allotments, Hackney Wick. [58]\\xa0In March 2008, Geoff Stokes, secretary of the NSALG, claimed that councils are failing in their duty to provide allotments. \"[T]hey sold off land when demand was not so high. This will go on because developers are now building houses with much smaller gardens. \"[56]\\xa0The\\xa0Local Government Association\\xa0has issued guidance asking councils to consider requiring developers to set land aside to make up for the shortfalls in allotment plots.\\n\\n[59]\\rAgainst the falling trend of land set aside for allotments is an increasing awareness of the need for cities to counter issues of food security and\\xa0climate change\\xa0through greater\\xa0self-sufficiency. This drive to expand allotments is also a response to food price inflation, a desire to reduce\\xa0food miles\\xa0and surplus provision of land in post-industrial towns and cities in the developed world. Some of these themes were taken up in a recent urban agriculture project in\\xa0Middlesbrough\\xa0in the\\xa0Tees Valley. [60]\\rMembers of Springfield Women\\'s Institute (WI) in Essex make chutney at a table set up in the garden of the rectory, August 1941. D4273\\rThe gendered origins of allotment spaces has been the subject of research, with findings including that a lack of toilets and sanitation can be a barrier to women, with some even miscarrying on their plots.
