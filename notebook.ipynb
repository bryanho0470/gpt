      "- 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n",
      "- 1 clove garlic, minced\n",
      "- Sesame seeds and green onions for garnish\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Slice the chicken breasts into thin strips or bite-sized pieces.\n",
      "2. In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, mirin, sugar, ginger, and garlic to make the teriyaki sauce.\n",
      "3. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\n",
      "4. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides.\n",

      "Enjoy your homemade Chicken Teriyaki! It's a classic Japanese dish that is sure to impress your taste buds.

      "1. **Tofu**: \n",
      "   - Use firm or extra-firm tofu for this recipe.\n",

      "   - Cut the tofu into thin strips or bite-sized pieces similar to the chicken.\n",
      "   - You can either pan-fry the tofu in a little oil until golden brown before adding the teriyaki sauce or simply add the tofu directly to the sauce to simmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Seitan**:\n",
      "   - Seitan is a high-protein meat substitute made from gluten, the protein in wheat.\n",
      "   - You can either make your own seitan from vital wheat gluten or purchase pre-made seitan from the store.\n",
      "   - Cut the seitan into thin strips or bite-sized pieces similar to the chicken.\n",
      "   - Sauté the seitan in a little oil until lightly browned before adding the teriyaki sauce.\n",
